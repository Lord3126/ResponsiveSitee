    <h3 class="title">About The R8</h3>
      <p>As halo cars go, the Audi R8 is a spectacular oneâ€”its howling V-10 engine provides stomach-punch acceleration that lesser cars with the four-ringed badge can only dream about. It's an aspirational performance car, but it's surprisingly easy to live with and drive daily thanks to a comfortable cabin, a silky ride, and plenty of standard luxury features. Buyers won't find it particularly fuel efficient and driving enthusiasts may grow disappointed with the R8's handling characteristics once the thrill of ten-cylinder power wears off. Still, the R8 is a deeply desirable and scintillatingly styled supercar that will turn heads forever, especially when that V-10 sings its sweet, sweet siren song.

<strong> Highs:</strong> Supercar appearance, simple but stylish cabin, intoxicating V-10 engine.
